## üìù Notes for Frontend Integration

1. **Authentication**: Store the JWT token in localStorage or sessionStorage
2. **Token Refresh**: Implement automatic token refresh before expiration
3. **Error Handling**: Handle 401 (Unauthorized) responses by redirecting to login
4. **Loading States**: Show loading indicators for all API calls
5. **Form Validation**: Implement client-side validation before API calls
6. **Pagination**: Use page and size parameters for list endpoints
7. **Search**: Implement search functionality using the search endpoints
8. **Real-time Updates**: Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time notifications

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   ./start-server.sh
   ```

2. Test all APIs:
   ```bash
   ./test-apis.sh
   ```

3. Use the API documentation above to integrate with your frontend
